### Hi there 👋

I am Pradyot H Adavi.

I am an Engineering Manager in Fintech and Payments Group ( FPG ) at Flipkart. Me and my team are responsible for democratising data for creating user insights. These insights are used for decision-making in products like Flipkart Pay Later and Flipkart-Axis Cobranded Cards. Prior to this role, I was a software engineer building systems and products in the domain of payments and affordability charter of Flipkart. I have a patent filed for System And Method For Facilitating Data Sharing ( Application No: 202141031528 ) with Indian Patent Office.

I have a Masters degree (M.Tech in Information Technology, 2014) from IIIT Bangalore. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), Karnataka in 2011. I completed my schooling at Dandeli, a small town in the Western Ghats region. While I am a native of Lingasugur, Bangalore has been my second home since 2017.

My interests are in the area of distributed systems, big data and blockchain.
